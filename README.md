Hello, we are RoboNYC, a RoboCup Junior team based in New York City. This repository contains our code. We focues on efficiency and understandability for our software, which you can see in our ultrasonic drive boundaries, homing program, and drive. Our original plan was to have a striker robot and a goalie robot with different programs. Whereas the striker robot would score and move freely around the field, the goalie robot would be confined to an area around the goal, and defend the ball. However, we realized that our goalie robot was not always reliable, and we decided to make both of our robots strikers to have a more stable offence. Our robots are identical hardware-wise, so it wasn't hard to redefine their positions. We hope that other RoboCUp Junior teams will appreciate our work and learn from our trials.
